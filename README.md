Codepinion is a platform :

- That allows you to **store and access your project’s source code** from any device with internet access.”
- That allows you to **edit and run your code** without having to download it locally, provided that the project’s **requirements** are already installed.
- In the future, an **AI assistant** will be implemented to make the work of programmers even easier.
